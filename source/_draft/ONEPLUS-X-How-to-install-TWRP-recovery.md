Hi,

I have a OnePlus X phone, I would use change the Oxygen OS to Cyanogen Mod 14 rom aka CM14.

I will give for you the feedback of my phone upgrade, so all the interesting points and problems I have encountered will be listed as well as the solutions.
 
# First Point Backup
 
 It's probably the most important point ! Change Rom on the phone Wipe all important data like a factory reset.
 I encourage you to do as much backup as possible

## TeamWin Recovery Project (TWRP)

TWRP is probably the best recovery for Android Phone, this usage is very simple and ergonomic : 
- It's show you the date and the current battery level;
- It's support keyboard;
- It's can create a full backup (include system partition) and given you the choice of the name of all backup made for your phone;
- It is fully touch-driven, has one of the most complete feature sets available, and uses a themable UI.
- ...
